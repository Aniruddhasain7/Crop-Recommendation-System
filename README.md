# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

An intelligent Machine Learning-based system designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in choosing the most suitable crop for their land. By analyzing soil composition and environmental conditions, the system provides high-accuracy recommendations to maximize yield and sustainability.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Precision Recommendations**: Predicts the best crop based on 7 critical environmental and soil parameters.
- **Top-3 Suggestions**: Provides the primary recommendation along with the next two most likely alternatives.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Displays a probability percentage for each recommendation.
- **Interactive UI**: A clean, modern, and responsive web interface built with Streamlit.
- **Instant Results**: Real-time processing of user inputs.

## 🧠 How It Works

The system utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on historical agricultural data. It considers the following inputs:

| Parameter          | Description                         |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Nitrogen (N)**   | Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil   |
| **Phosphorus (P)** | Ratio of Phosphorus content in soil |
| **Potassium (K)**  | Ratio of Potassium content in soil  |
| **Temperature**    | Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) |
| **Humidity**       | Relative humidity in %              |
| **pH Value**       | PH value of the soil (3.5 - 9.0)    |
| **Rainfall**       | Rainfall in mm                      |
